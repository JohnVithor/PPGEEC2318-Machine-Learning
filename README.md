## Task 01:
Write a concise summary, encapsulating the key insights and your personal understanding of the initial three chapters of "Designing Machine Learning Systems" by Chip Huyen, and compile it into a one-page document.

This summary should be uploaded to your repository either as a markdown file (e.g., readme.md) or, alternatively, crafted into a technical article and published on Medium.
